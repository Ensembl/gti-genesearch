# ADR 012: Nested join support

## TL;DR
Expression data is kept in two different Solr indices - analytics and experiment. We need to be able to combine data from both.

## Context
The `analytics` Solr index contains condition data, but as the unstored field `conditionSearch`. We can search on this field, but not display it. To display, we need to include `conditions` from the `baselineCondition` index, using the experiment expression to join the data.
